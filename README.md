✅ Attendance Tracker (C Project)
This is a simple Attendance Tracker written in C that allows you to manually mark students as present or absent. The program saves the attendance in a date-wise CSV file.

📌 Features
🕒 Automatically generates filename using current date

🧾 Stores attendance in a .csv file under the attendance/ folder

🙋 User-friendly CLI for marking each student's presence

📄 Each record includes: Serial No., Name, Roll No., Attendance

🛠️ How It Works
The program creates a file like attendance/10-05-2025.csv.

It asks you to input attendance status (0 for absent, non-zero or blank for present).

Marks attendance for each student and saves it.
